<html><body><p>Over the last two days I set up wordpress for makkarlabs.in - my first
attempt at wordpress. The idea was to put up the apps we build there, along

with related blogs. Though the home page could have been written in HTML

ourselves, I was for wordpress because adding another app would just mean a

new post. And I found Portfolio Press[1], a nice wordpress theme that comes

with the Portfolio post type[2] plugin, so could achieve exactly what I

wanted.



Of course some more tweaks in the theme and plugin, some PHP and patience

was involved in doing the whole thing. Added Twitter Feed[3] plugin too -

the plugin's great, it just took one line to include it in the sidebar, I

wish it would refresh real time though. Otherwise, I think it looks neat

now.



And I wrote my blog [4] on how we built badgeit :) Productive few days I

say.
